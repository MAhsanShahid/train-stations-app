# train-stations-app

## React-Native-App using TypeScript and GraphQL

### Pre-requisites:
- You have node.js installed in your system.
- Any Editor or IDE installed (I used IntelliJ IDEA).

### Setup:
1. Do the setup for Expo CLI. It can be found under the following link:
   https://docs.expo.io/workflow/expo-cli/
2. Get in to the directory with cloned project using terminal or command prompt with the command 'cd train-stations-app' in this case. 
3. Install all required packages by running command 'npm install' on terminal. It will automatically install all the required packages to make the app to work.
4. Once you are done with all the above mentioned steps and everything goes fine then you just have to run the app using command 'expo start'. It will open the  on browser for    debugging purpose only. But if you want to test it you have to run it on android by attaching your android or iphone device with it using cable for the first time with enabled    developer options and debugging mode(in case of android and do the required actions for ios respectively).
5. It will install 'Expo Go' app in your device.
6. Once it is done, now you can detach your device and just have to be connected with the same network in order to test it and it there will be any change in the code it will update and refresh the app automatically. If it will not work for you then you can simply refresh it by scanning QR-Code from the web interface.
